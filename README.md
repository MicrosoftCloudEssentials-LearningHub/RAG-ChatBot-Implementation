----------

> This approach focuses on `setting up the required infrastructure via Terraform`. It allows for source control of not only the solution code, connections, and setups `but also the infrastructure itself`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disclaimer: This repository contains example of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat bot with a basic architecture designed for scenarios without network isolation. This is `just a guide `. It is not an official solution guide. For official guidance, support, or more detailed information.
