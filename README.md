> Here is a [quick overview about RAG](./0_RAG_Overview.md), explaining how it works, its applications, and how to implement it using Azure AI services.

> [!TIP]
>
> - `Batch processing involves uploading files to SharePoint`, where they can be `processed later`. <br/>
> - `Real-time processing`, on the other hand, `would involve users uploading files directly within the app`, which could be stored in a `BLOB storage for immediate processing`.

## Where to start? 

- An `Azure subscription is required`. All other resources, including instructions for creating a Resource Group, are provided.
- `Contributor role assigned or any custom role that allows`: access to manage all resources, and the ability to deploy resources within subscription.

> RAG Solution Accelerators options:

- If you choose to use the [Basic Architecture](#basic-architecture), ([Terraform approach](./terraform-infrastructure/README.md)), please ensure that:
  - [Terraform is installed on your local machine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).
  - [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to work with both Terraform and Azure commands.
- If you opt for the [Zero Trust Architecture](#zero-trust-architecture), (Bicep approach), please ensure that you have installed all the requirements mentioned in the [prerequisites section](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) before proceeding.

## Basic Architecture

### Important Considerations for Production Environment

<details>
  <summary>Public Network Site</summary>
  
  > This example is based on a public network site and is intended for demonstration purposes only. It showcases how several Azure resources can work together to achieve the desired result.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Private Network Configuration</summary>

 > For enhanced security, consider configuring your Azure resources to operate within a private network. This can be achieved using Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to isolate your resources and control inbound and outbound traffic. Implementing private endpoints for services like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Functions can further secure your data by restricting access to your VNet.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Security</summary>

  > Ensure that you implement appropriate security measures when deploying this solution in a production environment. This includes: <br/>
  >
  > - Securing Access: Use Azure Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions. <br/>
  > - Managing Secrets: Store sensitive information such as connection strings and API keys in Azure Key Vault. <br/>
  > - Data Encryption: Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Scalability</summary>

  > While this example provides a basic setup, you may need to scale the resources based on your specific requirements. Azure services offer various scaling options to handle increased workloads. Consider using: <br/>
  >
  > - Auto-scaling: Configure auto-scaling for Azure Functions and other services to automatically adjust based on demand. <br/>
  > - Load Balancing: Use Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cost Management</summary>

  > Monitor and manage the costs associated with your Azure resources. Use Azure Cost Management and Billing to track usage and optimize resource allocation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Compliance</summary>

  > Ensure that your deployment complies with relevant regulations and standards. Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance and governance policies across your resources.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Disaster Recovery</summary>
   
> Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of failures. Use Azure Site Recovery and backup solutions to protect your data and applications.

</details>

## Zero Trust Architecture

> Zero Trust AI architecture in Microsoft Azure is a `security framework designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure by assuming that threats can come from both inside and outside the network`. This model operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify", meaning `every access request is thoroughly authenticated and authorized based on all available data points, regardless of its origin. The architecture integrates multiple layers of security, including strong identity verification, device compliance checks, and least privilege access, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access sensitive resources`. By continuously monitoring and validating each request, Zero Trust AI architecture helps organizations minimize risks and enhance their overall security posture.

### Step 1: Download the repository

> Standard orchestrator

  ```
  azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
  ```

> Add -b agentic if you want to use the Agentic AutoGen-based orchestrator

  ```
  azd init -t azure/gpt-rag -b agentic
  ```

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d2c66b-fd1e-4967-9f6c-ae02e27b2036>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update the information in the `GPT-RAG_SolutionAccelerator/infra/main.parameters.json` file, and make sure to save your changes before proceeding with the infrastructure deployment.

### Step 2: Enable network isolation

> Azure network isolation is a security strategy that segments a network into distinct subnets or segments, each functioning as its own small network. This approach enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and data leakage. In Azure, network isolation can be achieved using Virtual Networks (VNets), Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Private Link, allowing precise control over inbound and outbound traffic.

  ```
  azd env set AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION true  
  ```

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f493506-970d-4b1d-aee2-1b0972a365d7>

### Step 3: Login to Azure

> Make sure you log in to both:

1. Azure Developer CLI: 
      
      ```
      azd auth login
      ```

2. Azure CLI:

      ```
      az login
      ```

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8833ee-5edc-4d28-8b45-2d6ae75e2bf6>

### Step 4: Deploy the insfrastructure

> `azd provision` command in Azure Developer CLI (azd) automates the deployment of necessary Azure resources for an application. It uses infrastructure-as-code templates to set up Azure services, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments.

  ```
  azd provision
  ```

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015d2e96-978f-4606-beac-e25f03253585>

> Once it is finished, you will see something like this:

</div>

### Step 5: VM login

1. To proceed with the deployment, use the Virtual Machine connected via Bastion (set up in step 4).

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aee21cda-d047-4f6d-a568-8c9772639ca2" />

2. Log into the VM using the username and authenticate with the `password stored in the keyvault`, as illustrated in the figure below.

   <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b927de3-d54d-43b0-8fb1-7c0998827714>

   <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ec1fb6-d999-41e4-ac17-0c16b14a946d>

### Step 6: Install PowerShell 7 in the vm

> After logging into Windows, [install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package), as all other necessary components are already set up on the VM.

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c089a26e-8b31-466b-a052-a05d73d488fb>

### Step 7: Update azd on the VM

> Launch the `Command Prompt` and enter the following command to update azd to its latest version:

  ```
  choco upgrade azd  
  ```

  <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/777cdd6e-fa8f-49c2-9398-f94ac45be711>

### Step 8: Application deployment

> [!NOTE]
> Please review these configurations: <br/>
>
> - RemoteFX USB Device Redirection: Allows USB devices connected to your local computer to be used in the remote desktop session.`You can access and use local USB devices like storage drives, printers, or other peripherals directly from the remote session.` <br/>
> - Prompt for Credentials on the Client Computer: This setting ensures that users are prompted to enter their login credentials (username and password) on their local computer before they connect to the Remote Desktop Session Host server. `By entering credentials on the local computer, users are providing their login information in a trusted environment. This reduces the risk of credential theft or interception that might occur if credentials were entered on the remote server.` <br/>
> - Configure Server Authentication for Client: This setting controls how the client (your local computer) handles authentication when connecting to the Remote Desktop Session Host server. It ensures that the client verifies the server's identity before establishing a connection. `It provides users with confidence that their remote desktop session is secure and that they are connecting to the correct server.`

  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db726be0-49a7-4fe7-b042-b14aaa82983f" alt="Centered Image" style="border: 2px solid #4CAF50; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;"/>
  </div>
  
  <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf3df9d-8c77-42b8-9b84-6728ef4a3332>

1. Create a new folder, for example `deploy` as mentioned in the [official guide](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG?tab=readme-ov-file#zero-trust-architecture-deployment)
2. Once you've created the folder, go ahead and jump into it.

      ```
      mkdir deploy  
      cd deploy
      ```

    <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea84df0-ac9a-4cad-be91-bfb24548d1d1>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When executing the `azd init for the app` and `azd env refresh` commands, ensure that the `environment name, subscription, and region are consistent` with those used during the `initial infrastructure provisioning`.

3. Sets up a new project using the Azure GPT-RAG template: `azd init -t azure/gpt-rag`
  
    <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094a0830-2a33-42ae-821c-b8ae199fd772>

4. Logs you into Azure Developer CLI: `azd auth login`.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure your admin account is correctly configured with Authenticator.

  <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f34a13eb-b045-40c9-8f99-edc4dc9d0d15>

5. Logs you into your Azure account: `az login`

    <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfe9d038-4503-447e-b251-8da67bc0258a>

6. Updates your environment settings with the latest configuration: `azd env refresh`

      ```powershell
        PS C:\Users\vm-user\Downloads\RAG-ChatBot-Implementation\GPT-RAG_SolutionAccelerator\deploy> azd env refresh
        
        Refreshing environment gptbrowntest (azd env refresh)
        
        ? Select an Azure Subscription to use:  1. ME-timnab-1 (8237827342e0-9348)
          (âœ“) Done: Retrieving Azure deployment (gptbrowntest-1745337566)
          (âœ“) Done: Updated 63 environment variables
        
        Populated environment from Azure infrastructure deployment: gptbrowntest-1747566
        
        SUCCESS: Environment refresh completed
        View environment variables at C:\Users\vm-user\Downloads\RAG-ChatBot-Implementation\GPT-RAG_SolutionAccelerator\deploy\.azure\gptbrowntest\.env

      <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c3337e0-514c-4ad5-8324-e911d9542496>

8. Builds and packages your application code into deployable artifacts without deploying them to Azure: `azd package`

    > For example: 
  
    <div align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdbe03ab-080c-4d72-a449-8e7a60c35390" alt="Centered Image" style="border: 2px solid #4CAF50; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;"/>
    </div>

9. Deploys your project to Azure: `azd deploy`

    <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa248d9b-b1eb-42e3-9e6c-5e41bfdf5484>

> [!NOTE]
> **If you encounter an error with `azd deploy`:** 

```
ERROR: getting target resource: getting default resource groups for environment:
gpt-rag-resource-group: resource not found: 0 resource groups with prefix or suffix with value: 'gpt-rag-resource-group'
```

  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/844cea74-47b6-4682-a6af-c9b7d6c33059" alt="Centered Image" style="border: 2px solid #4CAF50; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;"/>
  </div>

> Please follow these steps to troubleshoot: <br/>
>
> - Review the `infra/main.parameters.json` file for missing or incorrect values.  
> - Run `az account show` to confirm you're logged into the correct Azure subscription.  
> - Run `azd env list` to check available environments.  
> - Run `azd env get-values` and make sure the values match those in `main.parameters.json`.  
> - Optionally, run `azd deploy --verbose` for more detailed error output.  
> For example: <br/>  
> If `main.parameters.json` contains `"location": "westus2"`, make sure your environment has `AZURE_LOCATION=westus2`.
