> E.g.0 Example of estimation: 

- Number of documents: 50
- Pages per document: 4
- Total pages: 200

   > Microsoft offers a free tier (F0) that allows users to test all its features. The free tier includes a `limited number of pages that can be scanned per request`. `As of now, the free allocation enables users to analyze up to two pages per request, and up to 500 pages included per month` If the total number of pages and features fall within the allowed usage, it can be used accordingly.

   > - Read: Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text, paragraphs, and detect languages from documents. It's a basic text extraction service. <br/>
   > - Add-on: Additional features of Form Recognizer that incur extra charges. E.g High Resolution, Font, and Formula. <br/>
   > - Query: Allows querying document content using natural language
