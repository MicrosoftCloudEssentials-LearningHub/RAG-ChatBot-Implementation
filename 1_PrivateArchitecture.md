> This demo is about how to setup secure document searches within a designated network, ensuring that your data remains protected while leveraging the capabilities of Azure OpenAI. <br/>

> You could use the `RAG pattern` to improve the search experience in your web application. For instance, when a `user queries the search system`, it can retrieve `relevant documents from Azure Storage Blob` Containers and use the `retrieved information to generate a more accurate and detailed search result`. [Click here for more information about RAG](./0_RAG_Overview.md).

    | **All networks**        | Allows access from any public IP address.                                   | Testing or development environments where security is not a primary concern. |
    | **Selected IP addresses** | Restricts access to specified public IP addresses.                         | Scenarios where you know the IP addresses of the clients that need to connect. |
    | **Disabled**            | Disables public network access entirely.                                    | Resources that should only be accessed from within a virtual network or through private endpoints. |

> [!NOTE]  
> About the exception checkmark `Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this search service`: <br/>
> This setting `allows trusted Azure services to bypass the network rules` and access your resource directly.
> These include services `like Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery`, and others that are part of the trusted services list.
> Even with this setting enabled, `proper authentication is still required` to access the resource, such as Managed Identity or Service Principal.
> `Only resources within the specified IP address ranges or virtual networks will have access`.
> Resources from other tenants or subscriptions will not have access `unless they are explicitly granted access through the whitelist or fall under the allowed exceptions`.
> This setting is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to allow Azure Site Recovery to access your search service for disaster recovery purposes without needing to configure additional network rules.

### Integrate with Virtual Network (VNet)

>  Deploy your VMs, Azure AI Search, and Azure OpenAI within the VNet.

1. **Navigate to VNet**: In the Azure portal, go to`Virtual networks` and select your VNet.
2. **Subnets**: Ensure that your subnets are correctly configured and have the necessary address space.
3. **Service Endpoints**: Add service endpoints for Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search.

### Configure Private Endpoints for Azure AI Search

1. **Navigate to Private Endpoint**: In the Azure portal, go to your Azure AI Search resource and select `Networking` > `Private endpoint connections`.
2. **Add Private Endpoint**: Click on `+ Private endpoint` to add a new private endpoint.
3. **Configure Private Endpoint**: Follow the prompts to configure the private endpoint
   - **Name**: Provide a name for the private endpoint.
   - **Virtual Network**: Select the same virtual network and subnet as used for Azure OpenAI.
   - **Integration**: Integrate with your DNS for name resolution.
4. **Approve Connection**: Once the private endpoint is created, approve the connection.

  |------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Shared Private Access** | - Simplifies the configuration by allowing you to create a private endpoint connection from Azure AI Search to Azure OpenAI without manually setting up private endpoints.<br>- Suitable when you want to establish a secure connection between resources in the same or different VNets.<br>- The connection must be approved by the owner of the target resource, adding an extra layer of security. | - VNet Peering or VPN Gateway is required if Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI are in different VNets.<br>- Network Security Groups (NSGs) should be configured to allow traffic between the VNets if they are peered. |
  | **Private Endpoint Connection** | - Provides a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.<br>- Ideal for securing the connection between Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI within the same Virtual Network.<br>- Offers a higher level of security by ensuring that the connection remains within the VNet.<br>- Can offer better performance as the traffic remains within the Azure backbone network. | - Requires manual setup of private endpoints for both Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI.<br>- DNS settings must be correctly configured to resolve the private endpoints.                                                |
  | **VNet Peering**       | - Enables resources in different VNets to communicate with low latency and high bandwidth, as if they were within the same network.<br>- Useful when Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI are in different VNets.<br>- Allows full connectivity between VNets, making it suitable for scenarios where multiple resources need to communicate across VNets. | - Peering links must be created in both VNets.<br>- NSGs should be configured to allow traffic from the peered VNet.<br>- Additional costs may be incurred for data transfer between VNets.                            |

  - Search for the resource ID of the Azure OpenAI service:

 - Create the shared private link or the `private endpoint` as needed:

### Create index/Upload Documents 

> Since now we are in a private network, Azure AI Search only admits requests from clients in a virtual network instead of over a public internet. So we need to create a VM, and set that VM in a VNET. Click [here for a more detailed guide on how to Create a private endpoint for a secure connection to Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/service-create-private-endpoint#use-the-azure-portal-to-access-a-private-search-service)

> Connect the Azure AI Search service with the VNET:

- Create a virtual machine:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01ae8cd-b421-4d13-8b98-4812541e7d86">

  - Provide the necessary details:

      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34fce8f1-ddf5-4cfa-8306-6c03f59c1cf7">


- Login into the VM, and go the AI Search. You can use Azure Bastion to connect.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f660ba8-694d-4cba-b65a-97d532b7c68b">

> Now you are able to access the AI Search behind the same private network.

- Create Index: Set up an index to store your documents.
